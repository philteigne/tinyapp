# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- bcryptjs
- cookie-parser
- cookie-session
- method-override

## Getting Started

- Install all dependencies (using the `npm install` command).
- Run the development web server using the `node express_server.js` command.

## Stretch Inclusions
- I included analytics information on both the /urls and /urls:id pages. The modules and the project outline mentioned different stretch goals so I did my best to accomodate both.
- I used method-override to use PUT and DELETE request handlers when necessary.
